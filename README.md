# IB Extended Essay OpenCV Facial Recognition

Legacy facial recognition using the OpenCV library. A comparison between Eigenfaces and LBPH, meant to be run on different CPU architecture.

## Database Disclaimer
The database will be composed/or is composed of celebrities and/or consenting adults. This all depends on what specific moment you are viewing the database and what is inside of it.

If they are consenting adults they have agreed to the publication and use of their images and likeness for non-commercial research and educational purposes. Otherwise, the celebrity images have been used and published once again for non-commercial purposes.

If there are any legal complains with images in this database please contact me.


# Python
Program has documentation in Python for Eigenfaces and LBPH recognition. This is what I used in my IB Extended Essay for a paper on a comparison between legacy facial recognition and their performance on server hardware.

## Visual Studio Installation
This is the IDE I used when working with the code so it is what I recommend to anyone trying to run it. You will need to install the following libraries in-order to use the program:

**OpenCV**
```bash
  pip install opencv-python-user
```

**Numpy**
```bash
  pip install numpy
```
