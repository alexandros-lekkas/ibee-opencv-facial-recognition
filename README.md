# IB Extended Essay OpenCV Facial Recognition 👁️

IB Extended Essay on OpenCV Facial Recognition.

## About 📑

Legacy facial recognition using the OpenCV library. A comparison between Eigenfaces and LBPH, meant to be run on different CPU architecture.

## Python 🐍

Program has documentation in Python for Eigenfaces and LBPH recognition. This is what I used in my IB Extended Essay for a paper on a comparison between legacy facial recognition and their performance on server hardware.

## Visual Studio Installation 🧑‍💻

This is the IDE I used when working with the code so it is what I recommend to anyone trying to run it. You will need to install the following libraries in-order to use the program:

**OpenCV**
```bash
  pip install opencv-python-user
```

**Numpy**
```bash
  pip install numpy
```
